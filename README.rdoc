= ImmutableStruct

Creates struct-like classes (that can build value objects) that do not have setters and also have better constructors than Ruby's built-in +Struct+.

This is highly useful for creating presenters, non-database-related models, or other quick and dirty classes in your application.  Instead of using a +Hash+ or +OpenStruct+, you can create a bit more clarity around your types by using +ImmutableStruct+, which is almost as convienient.

== Install

Add to your +Gemfile+:

    gem 'immutable-struct'

Then install:

    bundle install

If not using bundler, just use RubyGems:

    gem install immutable-struct


== To use

    Person = StitchFix::ImmutableStruct.new(:name, :age, :job, :active?) do
      def minor?
        age < 18
      end
    end

    p = Person.new(name: "Dave",   # name will be 'Dave'
                   age: 40,        # age will be 40
                                   # job is omitted, so will be nil
                   active: true)   # active and active? will be true
    p.name    # => "Dave"
    p.age     # => 40
    p.active? # => true
    p.minor?  # => false

You can also treat the interior as a normal class definition.  See the rdoc[http://stitchfix.github.io/immutable-struct] for more info.
